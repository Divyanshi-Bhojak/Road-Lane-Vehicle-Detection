The challenge of detecting road lanes, road markings, or vehicle tracking and detecting appears to be the most complicated task in modern autonomous driving. Therfore, I proposed an ensemble of both conventional computer vision approaches and deep learning models for most robust and accurate raod lane and vehicle detection. Implemented on three extensive datasets BDD100k dataset, Vehicle Detection Image Set, and KITTI dataset. 

The proposed methodology presents a framework of road and vehicle detection and output results shows testing them in different dynamic road scenes more than 95% cases gave effective detection results. The Below are some of the screen captures of results on the road on Surathkal, Mangalore, Karnataka, India.
